# ActiveLearning
In this demo, we show how to employ Active learning (AL) from scratch in a simple prediction task with Julia.
AL can be specially useful when unlabeled data is abundant but labeling is scarce.
We also show how Julia easily integrates to standard libraries, such as scikitlearn, ggplot, etc.
